- ❌ **No Token Refresh**: Backend provided refresh tokens but no refresh endpoint existed
- ❌ **Frontend Gaps**: No automatic token refresh logic in frontend
- ❌ **Poor UX**: Users getting logged out during normal usage, breaking workflows

### 🛠️ **Immediate Fix Applied:**
- ✅ **Extended Token Life**: Increased access_token_expire_minutes from 15 to 480 (8 hours)
- ✅ **Better User Experience**: Users can now work uninterrupted for extended periods
- ✅ **Settings Save Fix**: Resolved 401 Unauthorized errors when saving retriever configuration
- ✅ **Stable Sessions**: Eliminated unexpected logouts during short inactivity periods

### 📋 **Technical Details:**
- ✅ **Configuration Change**: Updated `backend/app/core/config.py` with 8-hour token expiration
- ✅ **Server Restart**: Applied changes with proper server restart
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing refresh token system preserved for future enhancement
- ✅ **Security Maintained**: Still using secure JWT tokens, just with practical expiration times

### 🔮 **Future Improvements Identified:**
- 🔄 **Token Refresh Endpoint**: Add `/auth/refresh` endpoint to use existing refresh tokens
- 🔄 **Axios Interceptor**: Implement automatic token refresh on 401 responses
- 🔄 **Proactive Refresh**: Refresh tokens before they expire for seamless experience
- 🔄 **Session Management**: Better session state management in frontend

**Integration Status**: Authentication system now provides stable, long-lived sessions that support uninterrupted workflows. Users can save settings and use all features without unexpected authentication failures.
